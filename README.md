# DE-Arms-RaceAn arms race, in its original usage, is a competition between two or more states to have the best
armed forces. Each party competes to produce more weapons, larger military, superior military
technology, etc. in a technological escalation. Back in the days of the cold war between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, the
greatest interest was in the "ARM RACE" between the two countries. And since the end of the
war, most of the scientists had focused on the regional antagonisms to analyze it. And before we get more further in the explanation of our subject we must mention who the
pioneer in this field was and what did he contribute with. "Lewis fry Richardson".
